       <pre> Happy Happier Happiest Birthday Sumaja of India.
        I feel its my fortune to have you,You sometimes heals me like no one can,
        Holding your hands even though it's always wet makes me feel moderate.
        The best thing is that your my selfie stick and pic partner too.
        Raising my voice to shatter your fans is the craziest.
        The most similar thing that we have is our love towards fruits.
        U have motivated me so many times unknowingly.
        I wish you reach the greatest heights and make impossibe as possible.
       <span style="color:darkmagenta" > Love you potti and thank me later for bearing you.</span>
        Don't abate your smile because it's the most beautiful thing happened to you.
       Wishing you tons of love and happiness.....
       More hugs and kisses tooo from me only(just joking) 
       Even after u got placed in an MNC 
       don't forget to climb the trees and stole those fruits as we do always..
       Love You Pottiiii..
